<title>Earths core consists mostly of Fe. The outer core is hot enough for the Fe to be liquid. The inner core, although even hotter, is under so much pressure that it is solid.
</title>
<meta name="description" content="The inner core is solid because it is made of very dense, or heavy, materials-like iron and nickel . Even though it is very hot, these materials dont melt very easily, so they stay solid. Answer 3: It turns out that many materials can be a solid at a higher temperature if the pressure is also higher.However, unlike the outer core, the inner core is not liquid or even molten. The inner cores intense pressure-the entire rest of the planet and its atmosphere-prevents the iron from melting. The pressure and density are simply too great for the iron atoms to move into a liquid state.The inner core is believed to be composed of an iron–nickel alloy with some other elements. The temperature at the inner cores surface is estimated to be approximately 5, 700 K (5, 430 °C; 9, 800 °F), which is about the temperature at the surface of the Sun.The Core is predominantly composed of iron and nickel. Even after 4.5 billion years of cooling, the Earths core remains very hot. The Earths core is divided into two layers, a solid inner core, and a liquid outer core. The Inner Core (D) (1216 km) is solid nickle-iron alloy.Evidence for a fluid outer core includes seismology which shows that seismic shear-waves are not transmitted through the outer core. Although having a composition similar to Earths solid inner core, the outer core remains liquid as there is not enough pressure to keep it in a solid state.">

</strong>-The inner core is solid because it is made of very dense, or heavy, materials-like iron and nickel . Even though it is very hot, these materials don’t “melt” very easily, so they stay solid.
