<meta name="description" content="Index fossils are fossils that are widespread but only existed for a short period of time. Index fossils help scientists to find the relative age of a rock layer and match it up with other rock layers. Living fossils are organisms that havent changed much in millions of years and are still alive today.If the same index fossil is found in different areas, the strata in each area were likely deposited at the same time. Thus, the principle of faunal succession makes it possible to determine the relative age of unknown fossils and correlate fossil sites across large discontinuous areas.Cross dating is a method of using fossils to determine the relative age of a rock. Fossil remains have been found in rocks of all ages with the simplest of organisms being found in the oldest of rocks. The more basic the organism the older the rock is.The principle of superposition states that the oldest sedimentary rock units are at the bottom, and the youngest are at the top. Based on this, layer C is oldest, followed by B and A. So the full sequence of events is as follows: Layer C formed.index fossil, any animal or plant preserved in the rock record of the Earth that is characteristic of a particular span of geologic time or environment. A useful index fossil must be distinctive or easily recognizable, abundant, and have a wide geographic distribution and a short range through time.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Index fossils are fossils that are widespread but only existed for a short period of time. Index fossils help scientists to find the relative age of a rock layer and match it up with other rock layers. Living fossils are organisms that havenâ€™t changed much in millions of years and are still alive today.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-If the same index fossil is found in different areas, the strata in each area were likely deposited at the same time. Thus, the principle of faunal succession makes it possible to determine the relative age of unknown fossils and correlate fossil sites across large discontinuous areas.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cross dating is a method of using fossils to determine the relative age of a rock. Fossil remains have been found in rocks of all ages with the simplest of organisms being found in the oldest of rocks. The more basic the organism the older the rock is.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The principle of superposition states that the oldest sedimentary rock units are at the bottom, and the youngest are at the top. Based on this, layer C is oldest, followed by B and A. So the full sequence of events is as follows: Layer C formed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-index fossil, any animal or plant preserved in the rock record of the Earth that is characteristic of a particular span of geologic time or environment. A useful index fossil must be distinctive or easily recognizable, abundant, and have a wide geographic distribution and a short range through time.
