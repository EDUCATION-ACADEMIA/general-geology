<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Superposition: The most basic concept used in relative dating is the law of superposition. Simply stated, each bed in a sequence of sedimentary rocks (or layered volcanic rocks) is younger than the bed below it and older than the bed above it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-law of superposition, a major principle of stratigraphy stating that within a sequence of layers of sedimentary rock, the oldest layer is at the base and that the layers are progressively younger with ascending order in the sequence.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The cross-cutting law says that if a rock is cut by another rock, then it is older than the rock which has cut it. Stratigraphy-The branch of geology that studies rock layers (strata) &amp; layering (stratification). It is primarily used in the study of sedimentary &amp; layered volcanic rocks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The principle of inclusions states that any rock fragments that are included in rock must be older than the rock in which they are included. For example, a xenolith in an igneous rock or a clast in sedimentary rock must be older than the rock that includes it (Figure 8.6).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The law of superposition is one of the principles of geology scientists use to determine the relative ages of rock strata, or layers. This principle states that layers of rock are superimposed, or laid down one on top of another. The oldest rock strata will be on the bottom and the youngest at the top.
