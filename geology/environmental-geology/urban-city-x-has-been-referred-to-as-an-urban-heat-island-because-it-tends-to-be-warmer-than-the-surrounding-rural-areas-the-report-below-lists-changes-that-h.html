<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-11 Urban City X has been referred to as an urban heat island because it tends to be warmer than the surrounding rural areas. The report below lists changes that have occurred in one year in Urban City X.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Nutrient pollution, which includes nitrates and phosphates, is the leading type of contamination in these freshwater sources. While plants and animals need these nutrients to grow, they have become a major pollutant due to farm waste and fertilizer runoff.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Which change would best aid a farmer in making the transition from conventional farming techniques to more sustainable farming techniques? Rotate the types of crops grown. Which would most likely cause a reduction in the amount of coal and natural gas on Earth? A continual increase in the number of people on Earth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-An increase in the frequency and intensity of felt earthquakes. Noticeable steaming or fumarolic activity and new or enlarged areas of hot ground. Subtle swelling of the ground surface. Small changes in heat flow. More items
