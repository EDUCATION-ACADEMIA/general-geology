<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The principle of cross-cutting relationships states that any geological feature that cuts across, or disrupts another feature must be younger than the feature that is disrupted. An example of this is given in Figure 8.7, which shows three different sedimentary layers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The principle of cross-cutting relationships states that any geological feature that cuts across or disrupts another feature must be younger than the feature that is disrupted.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cross-cutting relationships is a principle of geology that states that the geologic feature which cuts another is the younger of the two features. It is a relative dating technique in geology.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The principle of cross-cutting relationships Any geologic feature that crosscuts or modifies another feature must be younger than the rocks it cuts through. The cross-cutting feature is the younger feature because there must be something previously there to cross-cut.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The principle of cross-cutting relationships states that the geologic structure that cuts across another structure is younger than the structure it cuts across.
