<meta name="description" content="Answer and Explanation: The most likely geologic process to form the channel on Mars is continental drift, the same process that forms modern channels like the mid-Atlantic channel or the African Rift Valley. As the continental plates of Mars pull apart, they open up massive valleys that can be seen from space.In November 2020, astronomers reported newly found evidence for volcanic activity on Mars as recently as 53, 000 years ago. Such activity could have provided the environment, in terms of energy and chemicals, needed to support life forms.They are then presented with new information: conglomerate rock was found near the base of the channel on Mars. This evidence strongly supports the claim that the channel was formed by flowing water.We have considered satellite and aerial images of Earth showing landforms created by flowing lava and flowing water to see if these landforms were similar to the channel on Mars. These images gave us some evidence about what geologic process might have formed the channel.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The most likely geologic process to form the channel on Mars is continental drift, the same process that forms modern channels like the mid-Atlantic channel or the African Rift Valley. As the continental plates of Mars pull apart, they open up massive valleys that can be seen from space.

<strong>Concept note-2:
