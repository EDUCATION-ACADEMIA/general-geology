<strong> Why do scientists believe that Mars may have been habitable in the past? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** There is evidence that Mars could have had water. 
</p>
<p>(B) They found an alien burial site. 
</p>
<p>(C) Mars has a perfect climate, not too cold or too hot. 
</p>
<p>(D) They found bacteria cells in the rocks.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The confirmation that liquid water once flowed on Mars, the existence of nutrients, and the previous discovery of a past magnetic field that protected the planet from cosmic and solar radiation, together strongly suggest that Mars could have had the environmental factors to support life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Of all the planets in the solar system, Mars is the most Earth-like in terms of its water patterns. Mars has polar ice caps that grow and recede with the seasons and has evidence of water channels similar to those on Earth today.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Researchers have found a number of examples of deltas that formed in Martian lakes. Finding deltas is a major sign that Mars once had a lot of liquid water. Deltas usually require deep water over a long period of time to form. Also, the water level needs to be stable to keep sediment from washing away.
</p>

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Just like Earth, Mars likely got its water from asteroids and comets that bombarded its surface. Conditions may have been right for the red planet to be habitable from 4.1 to 3 billion years ago. During that time, life could have taken hold in global oceans, rivers, and lakes.
</p>

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The photos revealed a landscape full of riverbeds-evidence that the planet once had plenty of liquid water, even though it’s dry as a bone today. Since Mars doesn’t have tectonic plates to shift and bury the rock over time, ancient river tracks still lie on the surface like evidence abandoned in a hurry.
