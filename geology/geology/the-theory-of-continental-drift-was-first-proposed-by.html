He thought the force of Earths spin was sufficient to cause continents to move, but geologists knew that rocks are too strong for this to be true.The theory deals with the distribution of the oceans and the continents. According to Wegeners Continental Drift theory, all the continents were one single continental mass (called a Super Continent) – Pangaea and a Mega Ocean surrounded this supercontinent.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Wegener first presented his idea of continental drift in 1912, but it was widely ridiculed and soon, mostly, forgotten. Wegener never lived to see his theory accepted-he died at the age of 50 while on an expedition in Greenland. Only decades later, in the 1960s, did the idea of continental drift resurface.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-According to Wegener, all the continents formed a single continental mass and mega ocean surrounded the same. The supercontinent was named PANGAEA, which meant all earth. The mega-ocean was called PANTHALASSA, meaning all water. He argued that, around 200 million years ago, the supercontinent, Pangaea, began to split.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Alfred Wegener first presented his hypothesis to the German Geological Society on 6 January 1912. His hypothesis was that the continents had once formed a single landmass, called Pangaea, before breaking apart and drifting to their present locations.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The main reason that Wegener’s hypothesis was not accepted was because he suggested no mechanism for moving the continents. He thought the force of Earth’s spin was sufficient to cause continents to move, but geologists knew that rocks are too strong for this to be true.
