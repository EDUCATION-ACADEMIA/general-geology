<strong> Why is uniformitarianism an important principle to consider when making inferences about how Earth’s geology has changed over millions of years? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Uniformitarianism is about organisms forming at the horizon because of gravity. 
</p>
<p>(B) Uniformitarianism is rock that has broken and has a younger layer in the break. 
</p>
<p>(C) Uniformitarianism is when someone clones all organisms to make them identical to all other organisms on the planet. 
</p>
<p>(D) ** Uniformitarianism says that the processes that presently shape Earth have occurred in the past.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Uniformitarianism helps explain this because it suggests that the processes that we see today are the same as in the past and will be in the future. We cannot see rock formations and there for we have no idea how rocks actually form.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-This is known as uniformitarianism: the idea that Earth has always changed in uniform ways and that the present is the key to the past. The principle of uniformitarianism is essential to understanding Earth’s history. However, prior to 1830, uniformitarianism was not the prevailing theory.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Uniformitarianism. The principle of uniformitarianism states that processes that alter the earth’s crust are the same processes that occurred millions of years ago. Furthermore, the results of processes today are the same as the results of the same processes millions of years ago.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Why does the principle of uniformitarianism lead to the conclusion that the age of Earth is great? The major folds and unconformities seen in rocks could not have been produced in such a short time if the principle of uniformitarianism is applied.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Uniformitarianism happens over time and similar processes happen all the time. This is a principle that states that all geologic changes happen suddenly. Why do earth scientists need the principle of uniformitarianism in order to make predictions? they need this to calculate how old the earth is.
