It is a relative dating technique. The principle is important to the analysis of folded and tilted strata .According to the Principle of Original Horizontality, sediments are deposited horizontally.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The principle of original horizontality states that layers of sediment are originally deposited horizontally under the action of gravity. It is a relative dating technique. The principle is important to the analysis of folded and tilted strata .
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-According to the Principle of Original Horizontality, sediments are deposited horizontally. After they have been transformed into rock, strata may become tilted or folded by various tectonic movements. However, this principle basically states that “tilted or folded layers used to be flat”.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Law of Horizontality As sediments deposit, they deposit in horizontal layers. This is known as the Law of Horizontality. The oldest layers are at the bottom and the newest layers are at the top. If you were to dig down through the layers, you would be going back in geologic time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In short, each layer of sedimentary rock (also called a “bed”) is older than the one above it and younger than the one below it. Steno’s seemingly simple rule of superposition has come to be the most basic principle of relative dating.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The principle of original horizontality states that sediment is deposited horizontally. This is sometimes easier to envision with liquids: imagine pouring water into a cup. The surface of the water is perfectly flat-horizontal. If you dump that water into a bowl, the surface remains flat.
