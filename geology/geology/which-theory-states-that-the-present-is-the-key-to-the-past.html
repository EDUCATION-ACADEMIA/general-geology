<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The principle of uniformitarianism says that the present is the key to the past. This principle has had a profound impact on the science of geology.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Charles Lyell’s Principles of Geology was published between 1830-1833, and introduced the famous maxim, ‘the present is the key to the past’.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Uniformitarianism is a theory based on the work of James Hutton and made popular by Charles Lyell in the 19th century. This theory states that the forces and processes observable at earth’s surface are the same that have shaped earth’s landscape throughout natural history.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Self-conscious uniformitarianism first became salient in western thinking in the field of geology. It was proposed by James Hutton in 1785 and came to be known as “Huttonian theory.” Hutton argued that the geological past should be understood as the result of the same kinds of forces seen at work in the present.

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The two opposing schools of thought were known as “catastrophism” and “uniformitarianism". Catastrophism dates back as a scientific idea at least to Thomas Burnet’s Sacred History of the Earth (1681), which speculated that the Earth had started out smooth and perfectly round.
