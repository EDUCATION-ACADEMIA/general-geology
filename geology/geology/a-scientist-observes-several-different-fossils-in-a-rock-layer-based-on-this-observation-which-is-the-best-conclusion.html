<strong> A scientist observes several different fossils in a rock layer. Based on this observation, which is the best conclusion? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The fossils are composed of lava that cooled around several organisms. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** The fossils formed about the same time as the rock layer in which they were found. 
</p>
<p>(C) The fossils formed after heat and pressure changed the type of rock in the rock layer.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A scientist observes several dierent fossils in a rock layer. Based on this observation, which is the best conclusion? The fossils are composed of lava that cooled around several organisms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Relative age dating is used to determine whether one rock layer (or the fossils in it) are older or younger than another base on their relative position: younger rocks are positioned on top of older rocks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Which of the following is the most reasonable conclusion when fossils of these two different types of organisms are found in the same layers of rock? Crinoids and trilobites lived at the same time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The principle of superposition states that in an undeformed sequence of sedimentary rocks, each layer of rock is older than the one above it and younger than the one below it (Figures 1 and 2). Accordingly, the oldest rocks in a sequence are at the bottom and the youngest rocks are at the top.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-What could they determine about the fossils they were finding in the rocks based on this observation? Fossils in upper layers were younger than fossils in lower layers.
